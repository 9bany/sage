# Sage Examples

This folder contains all the examples for the Sage programming language. Each example is a separate standalone file that can be compiled and executed.

The `frontend` folder contains frontend (source code) examples.

The `lir` folder contains LIR (Low Intermediate Representation) examples.

The `asm` folder contains ASM (Assembly) examples.

The `vm` folder contains VM (Virtual Machine) examples.

Each of these folders are executed by [the compiler `tests`](../tests/README.md) and tested against the `.txt` files in [`test-output`](test-output/README.md) to ensure that they compile and run correctly.
